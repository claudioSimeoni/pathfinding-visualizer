        A Pathfinding Visualizer allows the user to see some "search algorithms" in action on a grid. In this case
        you will have the possibility to visualize three algorithms: <b>Depth First Search, Breadth First Search, and
            A*</b>.

        <h2>Setting up</h2>
        As a first step you should set up the <b>Start</b> and the <b>End</b> of the search, you can do so by
        clicking on the respective element on the toolbar and then by clicking the position you wanna set it to.
        Now it is time to set the walls, you can do it both by using the random maze (in this case for a path to
        exist between the two you must set the start and the end first) and setting the walls by hand (note that
        after you select the <b>Wall</b> element, once you click on the canvas, if you hold the click and slide
        walls will still be placed). You can also remove walls with the <b>Eraser</b> element.

        <h2>Running the algorithm</h2>
        Now you can eventually select the algorithm and the speed on the toolbar, once you have done this you can run
        the algorithm with the button on the top right. You will see an animation on the canvas showing each step of
        the search. Once the path is found some information will be added on the log under the legend.

        <h2>Reverting the state of the maze</h2>
        Once you finished the run, you have the following options:
        <ol>
            <li>Clearing the path and the visited cells with the dedicated button and run another algorithm.</li>
            <li>Resetting the board with the dedicated button.</li>
            <li>Change the current board as you prefer.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Algorithms implemented</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><b>DFS</b>: the most common graph searching algorithm, it simply visits the current node and runs
                recursively in all the other directions, in this case the order of the directions is fixed, one could 
                also implement it randomizing the directions. Time complexity: O(n). Space complexity: O(n).
            </li>
            <li><b>BFS</b>: the bfs computes the shortest path from the start to each cell by spreading each iteration
                from
                one of the visited cells with the shortest distance from the start. Time complexity: O(n). Space
                complexity: O(n).
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>A*</b>: this algorithm works as Dijkstra's algorithm but by using an heuristic: the next node, instead of
                being the one with the current shortest distance (between the not fully visited ones), will be the one
                with the shortest "distance + (manhattan distance from the end point)". In this way we avoid paths that
                spread to far from the end point we want to reach. Note that differently from the other two algorithms,
                we are using the final position as an information, in this sense the algorithm is said to be informed.
                Time complexity: O(n<sup>2</sup>). Space complexity: O(n).
            </li>
        </ol>
        The n in the complexities refers to the total number of cells.

        <h2>Signing up</h2>
        You can sign up and save your favorite mazes on your profile and then load it whenever you want. Note that
        saving a board won't save the positions of the start and the end but only the maze.
