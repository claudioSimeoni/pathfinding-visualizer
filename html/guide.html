        A Pathfinding Visualizer allows the user to see some "search algorithms" in action on a grid.

        <h2>Setting up</h2>
        As a first step you should set up the <b>Start</b> and the <b>End</b> of the search, you can do so by 
        clicking on the respective element on the toolbar and then by clicking the position you wanna set it to. 
        Now it is time to set the walls, you can do it both by using the random maze (in this case for a path to 
        exist between the two you must set the start and the end first) and setting the walls by hand (note that 
        after you select the <b>Wall</b> element, once you click on the canvas, if you hold the click and slide 
        walls will still be placed). You can also remove walls with the <b>Eraser</b> element.

        <h2>Running the algorithm</h2>
        Now you can eventually select the algorithm and the speed on the toolbar, once you have done this you can run 
        the algorithm with the button on the top right. You will see an animation on the canvas showing each step of 
        the search. Once the path is find some information will be added on the log under the legend.

        <h2>Reverting the state of the maze</h2>
        Once you finished the run, you have the following options: 
        <ol>
            <li>Clearing the path and the visited cells with the dedicated button and run another algorithm.</li>
            <li>Resetting the board with the dedicated button.</li>
            <li>Change the current board as you prefer.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Algorithms implemented</h2>

        <h2>Some other features</h2>
        Firstly you can select the <b>Theme</b> of the page on the top right corner. Secondly you can signup and save 
        your favorite mazes on your profile and then load it whenever you want. Note that saving a board won't save the
        positions of the start and the end.
