My idea is to make a site with a grid at the center, you choose a starting and an ending point and you can see how different algs (DFS, BFS, A*) reach the end from the beginning. This seems easy to make but still quite impressive.

-theme
-any other algs

-saving boards 
-do the history of the project
-do the log in 

-tell about problems you had: eg the maze, firstly you did fisheryatesshuffle, then the current way using a montecarlo simulation to find out the average number of time it had to run
