My idea is to make a site with a grid at the center, you choose a starting and an ending point and you can see how different algs (DFS, BFS, A*) reach the end from the beginning. This seems easy to make but still quite impressive.

-theme
-any other algs

-saving boards 
-do the history of the project
-do the log in 

-tell about problems you had: eg the maze, firstly you did fisheryatesshuffle, then the current way using a montecarlo simulation to find out the average number of time it had to run

asynchronous operations are simply operations that needs to be run on the browser or somewhere else, so normally instead of waiting the browser continues to run the function and doesnt wait for the result, but with async await you don't have this problem anymore

the idea behind cookies and tokens is the following:
