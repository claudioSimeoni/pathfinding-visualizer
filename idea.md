My idea is to make a site with a grid at the center, you choose a starting and an ending point and you can see how different algs (DFS, BFS, A*) reach the end from the beginning. This seems easy to make but still quite impressive.

-do the history of the project
-tell about problems you had: eg the maze, firstly you did fisheryatesshuffle, then the current way using a montecarlo simulation to find out the average number of time it had to run 

understanding well all of the xss and sqlinj function but in general take a look at all the advices and projects to every bro   

make the code maintainable and good in general, ask geppetto about important things for step


. check the problems with async
(you have also the bug that when you run twice the dfs, the second times after it reaches the end, it goes on)

. add algorithms 
. do the guide, the readme and the license
. add all the comments and refactor everything
. make the number of cell and the sizes fixed
. add that when you slide to set walls you are vibing 
(use the mousover mousedown etc)

. learn everything you are missing and then update all the notes
. solve login problem
. take a look at the part of input validating and vulnerabilities
. canvas and in general that adapts to the page? 

. the idea is, once you think you are done, you : -try the code on the vm, -read the assignment carefully, -check ALL the code, -testtesttest, -format the code and comment it well

.do all of the well understanding all the code of others and in general understand all the pweb features you have not learned yet

understanding all of this local hosting stuff, xampp setup guide stuff
understanding well the workflow in general and how async actually works
study well ALL of the web security
cercare il bot di 40 e guardare come funziona tutta la parte del login


the idea behind async is roughly the following: 
asynchronous operations are simply operations that needs to be run on the browser or somewhere else, so normally instead of waiting the browser continues to run the function and doesnt wait for the result, but with async await you don't have this problem anymore

the idea behind cookies and tokens is the following: 
the token is like a key that your browser stores and uses whenever you need to prove your identity again instead of having to do the login everytime. cookies is information sent by the server that the server stores and sends back every time it does a request to the same site
