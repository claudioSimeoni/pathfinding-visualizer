My idea is to make a site with a grid at the center, you choose a starting and an ending point and you can see how different algs (DFS, BFS, A*) reach the end from the beginning. This seems easy to make but still quite impressive.

-theme
-any other algs

-saving boards 
-do the history of the project
-do the log in 

-tell about problems you had: eg the maze, firstly you did fisheryatesshuffle, then the current way using a montecarlo simulation to find out the average number of time it had to run

understanding all of this local hosting stuff, xampp setup guide stuff

make the code maintainable and good in general, ask geppetto about important things for step

when you go to the aesthetic part take a look at geopops 

understanding well the workflow in general and how async actually works

format selection

colore di quando sottolinei 

add a gitignore

the idea behind async is roughly the following: 
asynchronous operations are simply operations that needs to be run on the browser or somewhere else, so normally instead of waiting the browser continues to run the function and doesnt wait for the result, but with async await you don't have this problem anymore

the idea behind cookies and tokens is the following: 
the token is like a key that your browser stores and uses whenever you need to prove your identity again instead of having to do the login everytime. cookies is information sent by the server that the server stores and sends back every time it does a request to the same site

understanding well all of the xss and sqlinj function but in general take a look at all the advices and projects to every bro   

study well ALL of the web security
